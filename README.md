As I was teaching myself to use SQL, I thought that there was a much easier way to streamline the process of making queries, and I was also eager to develop my skills in React.js, Node.js, and integrating API's into websites using Express.js. Thus, this project came about. I learned an extensive amount about the process of developing a full-stack application, how finnicky working out API requests to servers can be, and the fun of using technology to make my life easier!.
